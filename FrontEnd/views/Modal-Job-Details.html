                Able builds technology products in a portfolio model. We
                believe that people, teams, and processes are more important
                than the ideas themselves, so we’ve focused on bringing
                great people together, and investing in their growth. We’ve
                built products in a variety of industries. Everything from
                media to finance to toys to healthcare. Sometimes we work
                with management teams to help their businesses grow faster
                or unlock value using technology. Other times we start or
                buy businesses outright. Each time, we look for
                opportunities to leverage technology built at the
                portfolio-level to drive value faster. We believe that a
                diverse team brings extraordinary success and we have
                created a work environment geared towards work/life balance
                and happiness. Able is committed to inclusion and diversity
                and is an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will
                receive consideration without regard to race, color,
                religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation,
                national origin, disability, or veteran status.
